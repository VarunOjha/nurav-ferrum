# Wiki log

Append-only, chronological (SCHEMA §12). New entries go at the end; existing entries are never edited. Last five entries: `grep "^## \[" wiki/log.md | tail -5` (Git Bash). The s01 entries below were written by the integrator at the end of the multi-agent run, because log.md did not exist while the areas were drafted.

## [2026-10-08] ingest | Raw sources: master prompt and owner scoping decisions

- session: s01
- sources: [raw/00-master-prompt.md, raw/01-scoping-decisions.md]
- result: master prompt stored verbatim; owner answers Q1-Q14, owner directives 1-9 and the observed environment recorded (raw/01 records the owner's words verbatim-in-substance). Both files are immutable.

- session: s01
- pages: [ov-risk-register, risk-r01, risk-r02, risk-r03, risk-r04, risk-r05, risk-r06, risk-r07, risk-r08, risk-r09, risk-r10, risk-r11, risk-r12, risk-r13, risk-r14, risk-r15, risk-r16, risk-r17, risk-r18, risk-r19, risk-r20, risk-r21, risk-r22, risk-r23, risk-r24, risk-r25]
- result: 26 pages written by the area agent in its owned paths. risk-r01 to risk-r06 from raw/01 plus newly identified risk-r07 to risk-r25.

## [2026-10-08] plan | Research area drafted (multi-agent)

- session: s01
- pages: [exp-baseline-footprint, exp-energy, exp-isolation-overhead, exp-lifecycle-policies, exp-navigation, exp-reliability, exp-rendering, exp-security-overhead, exp-startup, hyp-01, hyp-02, hyp-03, hyp-04, hyp-05, hyp-06, hyp-07, hyp-08, hyp-09, hyp-10, hyp-11, hyp-12, hyp-13, hyp-14, hyp-15, metric-canvas-throughput, metric-cpu-package-energy, metric-crash-count, metric-frame-interval, metric-frame-miss-rate, metric-lifecycle-transitions, metric-loaf-blocking, metric-memory-growth-slope, metric-nav-failure-rate, metric-nav-latency, metric-objective-j, metric-peak-tree-private-commit, metric-policy-eval-latency, metric-process-count, metric-recovery-time, metric-restore-latency, metric-restore-success-rate, metric-safety-violations, metric-startup-fcp, metric-startup-lcp, metric-startup-window-visible, metric-tree-cpu-cycles, metric-tree-cpu-time, metric-tree-private-commit, metric-tree-private-working-set, metric-tree-working-set, metric-wall-energy, ov-research-configurations, ov-research-experiment-log, ov-research-fairness-protocol, ov-research-objective-function, ov-research-paper-plan, ov-research-plan, ov-research-related-work-seed, ov-research-statistical-analysis-plan, ov-research-threats-to-validity, ov-research-traceability, ov-research-workload-catalog, rq-01, rq-02, rq-03, rq-04, rq-05, rq-06, rq-07, wl-canvas-webgl, wl-continuous-scroll, wl-frequent-nav, wl-large-dom, wl-many-background, wl-multi-active, wl-public-supplementary, wl-security-nav-mix, wl-session-churn, wl-spa-js-heavy, wl-static-info, wl-video-playback]
- result: 81 pages written by the area agent in its owned paths. Research questions, hypotheses, experiments, metrics, workloads and narrative pages. No measurements exist.

## [2026-10-08] plan | Quality area drafted (multi-agent)

- session: s01
- pages: [qual-ci-plan, qual-definition-of-done, qual-phase-gate-checklist, qual-security-testing-plan, qual-testing-strategy]
- result: 5 pages written by the area agent in its owned paths.

## [2026-10-08] plan | Interactive-plan area drafted (multi-agent)

- session: s01
- pages: [ip-approvals-api, ip-build-plan, ip-data-contract, ip-routes-and-views, ip-spec, ip-testing, ip-wiki-lint]
- result: 7 pages written by the area agent in its owned paths. Specification of the plan app only; interactive_plan/ itself is not built.

## [2026-10-08] plan | Multi-agent review of all areas

- session: s01
- result: review agents read every area and raised 52 issues in total (count reported by the orchestrating workflow; the per-lens breakdown was not passed to the integrator). Area agents then applied fixes in their owned paths; individual dispositions are not recorded here.

## [2026-10-08] plan | Completeness critic pass

- session: s01
- result: a completeness critic raised 23 gaps (high, medium and low) covering SCHEMA, index/log, the open-questions register, approval waves, plan-app pages, ADR authority, phase pages P1/P2/P4/P7, lint tooling, raw manifest, resume rules, STATUS and repo layout. Dispositions are in the next two entries and in STATUS.md.

## [2026-10-08] schema | SCHEMA amendment batch (integration)

- session: s01
- pages: [schema]
- result: applied in SCHEMA.md and mirrored in CLAUDE.md: handoff file name handoff-YYYY-MM-DD-sNN.md (Q-004); overview allowed in research/ and risks/ (Q-207 default); type status for STATUS.md; research-note basename exemption; connects [] rule; registry (comp-tab-content, comp-windows-os, comp-competitor-browsers; adr-0019, next adr-0020; risks to r25, next r26); §9.6 RESUME equal to CLAUDE.md §1; §9.7 P0 bootstrap exception, CONTRADICTION and ungated-Q rules; §9.1.1 contradicting an accepted ADR; §3.1 open/sealed bench runs and MANIFEST.sha256 from p0.8; §9.3 LOG-FORMAT, Q-FORMAT, Q-BLOCK-UNGATED, PHASE-DONE-NO-EXIT, TS lint normative; §9.5 bookkeeping commit; §10.2 bootstrap_hash for CLAUDE.md; §10.4(b) covers only quoted owner choice; §11 raw ids.
- stales: [schema] (no approvals exist yet, so nothing is actually stale)

## [2026-10-08] ingest | Evidence: WebView2 runtime registry version

- session: s01
- pages: [phase-p1-foundation, ops-environment-setup]
- sources: [raw/evidence/phase-p0-planning/env-webview2-pv.txt]
- result: reg query of the EdgeUpdate client key returned pv 154.0.4258.62, matching raw/01; the `UNVERIFIED` tag on the key path in phase-p1-foundation was removed and p1.2 re-reads the value.

## [2026-10-08] plan | Integration: completeness gaps addressed

- session: s01
- pages: [ov-open-questions, ops-approval-workflow, qual-phase-gate-checklist, phase-p0-planning, phase-p1-foundation, phase-p2-minimal-container, phase-p3-tabs-sessions, phase-p4-security, phase-p5-telemetry, phase-p6-benchmark-harness, phase-p7-lifecycle, phase-p8-research-paper, adr-0001, adr-0002, adr-0003, adr-0004, adr-0005, adr-0006, adr-0007, adr-0008, adr-0009, adr-0010, adr-0011, adr-0012, adr-0013, adr-0014, adr-0015, adr-0016, adr-0018, ip-build-plan, ip-spec, ip-approvals-api, ip-data-contract, ip-routes-and-views, ip-testing, ops-wiki-maintenance, ops-resume-after-interruption, ops-session-protocol, ops-handoff-template, ops-environment-setup, ov-arch-repo-layout, comp-interactive-plan, ov-project, ov-research-plan, exp-baseline-footprint, exp-energy, exp-navigation, exp-reliability, exp-rendering, exp-security-overhead, exp-isolation-overhead, risk-r01, risk-r02, risk-r03, risk-r04, risk-r05, risk-r06, ov-risk-register, qual-definition-of-done]
- result: register reconciled (Q-101 answered by directives 2 and 4; Q-109 moved to P2; Q-107/Q-123 drop risk ids; Q-202 also gates P2; Q-208 to Q-217 added from writers' questions); approval waves added (ops-approval-workflow §8); case-(b) ADRs split into quoted owner decision and Claude elaboration; plan-app snapshot diff, bootstrap hash, fail-closed Q parsing, Node 24-only gate and lint stop conditions specified; P1 gains cargo-deny install, --locked, Windows PowerShell, p1.17 Tauri CLI pins, Job Object attribution check, adr-0019 and comp-windows-os; P2 gains adr-0019, Q-202 criterion, ADRs-from-p1.9 rule, Rust fixture server; P4 allowlist cases; P7 task p7.14 (campaign C2b); risk spikes assigned (r01 p1.6, r02 p1.5, r03 p1.7, r04 p6.9, r05 p5.2, r06 p1.8) and risk-r07+ added to owner phases; repo layout adds spikes/, tools/, plan/snapshots/; MANIFEST.sha256 moved to p0.8.
- stales: [] (no approvals exist yet)

## [2026-10-08] plan | Integration: index.md created

- session: s01
- pages: [index]
- result: catalogue of every non-raw page plus raw sources, grouped per SCHEMA §11.

## [2026-10-08] lint | Integration lint over the whole wiki

- session: s01
- pages: [index, log, status-live]
- result: 0 errors, 0 warnings. Throwaway PyYAML-based lint (session scratchpad) over 191 files with frontmatter (184 wiki pages, 5 raw research notes, index, STATUS.md) plus 3 raw files without frontmatter. Checked FILE-ENCODING, frontmatter parse, FM-MISSING, FM-ENUM, FM-TYPE-DIR, ID-PATTERN, ID-DUP, REF-DANGLING (frontmatter ids, connects.to, risk spike task ids, phase ids inside `UNVERIFIED[...]` tags, relative body links), REF-RECIPROCAL, TRUST-EDGE, ADR-CHAIN (structural), ADR-SECTIONS, PHASE-ORDER (unique order and task ids, depends_on DAG acyclic), UNV-NOPHASE, INDEX-MISSING and §11 line format, LOG-FORMAT, Q-FORMAT, Q-BLOCK-UNGATED, ORPHAN. The quick lint embedded in ops-wiki-maintenance §5 also reports 0 errors. Not checked here (left for p0.8): UNV-PASTDUE, INT-NUMBER-NOSRC, CONTRADICTION reading pass, SCHEMA-SPLIT semantic pass, RAW-IMMUTABLE (no git history and no manifest yet), STALE-UPDATED (no commits), APPROVAL-STALE (no approvals file).
- next: p0.8 manual lint evidence and MANIFEST.sha256; then ask the owner Approval Wave 0 and Q-104 (see STATUS.md)

## [2026-10-08] ingest | Owner answers, Approval Wave 0 (s01)

- session: s01
- pages: [ov-open-questions, adr-0005, adr-0011, ops-git-conventions, ops-session-protocol, ops-environment-setup, ops-approval-workflow, index, status-live]
- sources: [raw/owner/2026-10-08-s01-wave0.md]
- result: Q-006 (yes, app appends approval log entries), Q-007 (no reset-to-pending), Q-102 (stay on Node 24 LTS), Q-103 (mermaid 12.x exact pin, fallback 11.17.2), Q-104 (local commits yes, one per verified task, never push) and Q-210 (yes to @vitest/coverage-v8 exact pin and playwright chromium download) set to answered with quotes and the source path. Chat approval of the seven ip-* pages and adr-0016 recorded as Approval Wave 0 (ops-approval-workflow §8); those pages were not edited, so the content the owner approved is unchanged. adr-0011, ops-git-conventions and ops-session-protocol now state that local commits are authorised. ops-environment-setup records Node v24.20.0 installed by Claude on the owner's authorisation and not on the default PATH of the Claude Code Bash shell (workaround: prepend /c/Program Files/nodejs). The standing directive "Feel free to run install." contradicts accepted adr-0005 (owner runs winget): CONTRADICTION blockquote added below its Decision section and new Q-218 (blocking phase-p1-foundation) registered per SCHEMA §9.1.1; the ADR's decision text is unchanged. Raw file added to index.md (it had been committed without an index line). Q-216 stays open, so the quick lint runs from the scratchpad.
- stales: [adr-0005, adr-0011, ops-git-conventions, ops-session-protocol, ops-environment-setup, ops-approval-workflow] (no approvals.json exists yet, so nothing is actually stale)

## [2026-10-08] lint | p0.8 manual lint over the whole wiki + raw manifest

- session: s01
- pages: [ov-arch-data-flows, ops-git-conventions, glossary, ov-open-questions, ops-environment-setup, index, status-live]
- sources: [raw/evidence/phase-p0-planning/wiki-lint-manual.md]
- result: 0 errors, 33 warnings. Quick lint (ops-wiki-maintenance §5, scratchpad copy; Q-216 open) 191 files, 0 errors; integration lint (PyYAML) 0 errors, 0 warnings; manual checks UNV-PASTDUE 0, STALE-UPDATED 0, RAW-IMMUTABLE 0 (9 raw files, one commit each), HYP-NO-DATA 0, PHASE-DONE-NO-EXIT 0, ADR-CHAIN 0, FM-UNKNOWN-KEY 0, SCHEMA-SPLIT 0, APPROVAL-STALE n/a (no approvals.json). Warnings and dispositions: INT-NUMBER-NOSRC 23 (all planned thresholds or parameters, accepted); CONTRADICTION 3 (adr-0005/Q-218 new, adr-0009, adr-0010; all registered, accepted); UNV-MIRROR 7 remaining (phase pages keep claims in frontmatter, ov-arch-configuration tag in a fenced example; accepted) after fixing 4 pages. Reading-pass findings left for the Wave 1 revision: ip-build-plan IP-0 step 3 and phase-p0-planning p0.9 say the owner installed Node (Claude did, on authorisation; Q-218), ip-wiki-lint §3 says P1 owns the manifest format (SCHEMA §3.1 wins). Index lines added for raw/owner/2026-10-08-s01-wave0.md and the evidence file. MANIFEST.sha256 created: sha256 at lint time (9 lines) 238187b62c3e9d53d2df7ac188ad31b6c63c99367806a0220556bb46ee890129; after appending the evidence line (10 lines) 326c7577aaccd8a015bb979da0c36c39e68a3ecfa294a92cf1298860aa7b4874.
- stales: [ov-arch-data-flows, ops-git-conventions, ops-environment-setup] (no approvals.json exists, so nothing is actually stale)
- next: p0.9 / IP-0: record node -v, npm -v, git --version as raw/evidence/phase-p0-planning/interactive-plan/IP-0-toolchain.txt
- commit: 04b27b9

## [2026-10-08] code | p0.9 (IP-0 preconditions): toolchain recorded, Node gate passed

- session: s01
- pages: [ov-open-questions, status-live]
- sources: [raw/evidence/phase-p0-planning/interactive-plan/IP-0-toolchain.txt, raw/owner/2026-10-08-s01-wave0.md]
- result: IP-0 preconditions 0-2 hold (p0.8 lint clean, Wave 0 transcribed, Q-006/Q-007/Q-103/Q-210 answered). With PATH prefixed by /c/Program Files/nodejs: node -v v24.20.0, npm -v 11.19.0, git --version 2.52.0.windows.1; gate (major 24 and >= 24.15) PASS, exit 0. Evidence appended to MANIFEST.sha256 (11 lines, verify 0 problems). Adding the evidence file makes the quick lint report 1 INDEX-MISSING error, because SCHEMA §11 index ids must be lower case and the mandated name is IP-0-toolchain; registered as Q-219 (lint semantics, owner decides) and not worked around. Build paused before IP-1 per the ip-build-plan stop condition on SCHEMA ambiguities that change lint semantics.
- next: owner answers Q-219, then p0.10 / IP-1 (scaffold + spikes)
- commit: 1cfc2d5

## [2026-10-08] ingest | Owner answers Q-216, Q-218, Q-219 (wave 0b, s01)

- session: s01
- pages: [ov-open-questions, adr-0005, ops-environment-setup, phase-p1-foundation, phase-p0-planning, phase-p8-research-paper, adr-0006, adr-0009, adr-0011, adr-0017, qual-ci-plan, risk-r20, ops-approval-workflow, ops-wiki-maintenance, ip-wiki-lint, index]
- sources: [raw/owner/2026-10-08-s01-wave0b.md]
- result: Q-216 (commit the lint and approval-check scripts under tools/), Q-218 (Claude runs all toolchain installs incl. MSVC Build Tools; owner clicks UAC; kernel drivers need separate approval; adr-0005 superseded) and Q-219 (index lists evidence folders, not files) set to answered with quotes and the source path. Raw file appended to MANIFEST.sha256 and listed in index.md. The adr-0005 CONTRADICTION blockquote is resolved (rewritten as "Resolved contradiction", decision text unchanged). Pages that said the owner runs installs now cite adr-0021. adr-0016 and ip-build-plan (chat-approved, Wave 0) still list adr-0005 in related and quote the owner's Q13 wording; they were deliberately not edited, to keep the Wave 0 approval intact (a superseded ADR is still a valid reference).
- stales: [adr-0005, ops-environment-setup, phase-p1-foundation, phase-p0-planning, phase-p8-research-paper, adr-0006, adr-0009, adr-0011, adr-0017, qual-ci-plan, risk-r20, ops-approval-workflow, ops-wiki-maintenance, ip-wiki-lint] (no approvals.json exists, so nothing is actually stale; this stales approval of ip-wiki-lint, chat-approved in Wave 0, edited under SCHEMA §10.4 rule 2)
- commit: a68667b

## [2026-10-08] decide | adr-0020 (index lists evidence folders) and adr-0021 (Claude runs toolchain installs, supersedes adr-0005)

- session: s01
- pages: [adr-0020, adr-0021, adr-0005, phase-p1-foundation, ops-approval-workflow, index]
- sources: [raw/owner/2026-10-08-s01-wave0b.md]
- result: adr-0020 and adr-0021 created with decided_by owner and status accepted under SCHEMA §10.4 rule 3(b) (verbatim owner decision quoted; Claude elaboration binding only once APPROVED in the plan app). adr-0021 supersedes adr-0005, which is set to superseded with superseded_by adr-0021. phase-p1-foundation decisions now list adr-0021 instead of adr-0005 (Wave 2 table in ops-approval-workflow §8 updated likewise); Q-218 no longer holds P1 entry. Next free ADR id adr-0022.
- stales: [adr-0005, phase-p1-foundation, ops-approval-workflow] (no approvals.json exists, so nothing is actually stale)
- commit: a68667b

## [2026-10-08] schema | SCHEMA §11 raw evidence/bench folders (adr-0020), §8 registry, §9.3 tools/ fallback; CLAUDE.md

- session: s01
- pages: [schema, ip-wiki-lint, ops-wiki-maintenance]
- sources: [raw/owner/2026-10-08-s01-wave0b.md]
- result: SCHEMA §11: files under raw/evidence/ and raw/bench/ are no longer listed individually; each first-level folder (raw/evidence/<phase-id>/, raw/bench/<run-id>/) gets one index line, label = folder path relative to wiki/raw/, lower-cased, non-[a-z0-9.-] characters replaced by -, no trailing -; link = folder path with trailing slash; a file directly in raw/evidence/ or raw/bench/ is INDEX-MISSING; raw top-level, raw/owner/, raw/research/ and raw/assets/ files are still listed per file. The §11 line regex is unchanged. §9.3 INDEX-MISSING row and the fallback lint location (tools/quick_lint.py) updated; §8 registry adr-0001…adr-0021, next free adr-0022. CLAUDE.md §1 step 3 and §5 point to tools/approvals_check.py and tools/quick_lint.py; §9 and §11 state that toolchain installs are pre-authorised (adr-0021) while kernel drivers still need the owner. ip-wiki-lint INDEX-MISSING and the ops-wiki-maintenance §5 quick lint implement the same rule. Index: per-file lines for env-webview2-pv and wiki-lint-manual replaced by the folder line evidence-phase-p0-planning.
- stales: [schema, ip-wiki-lint, ops-wiki-maintenance] (schema also via the CLAUDE.md bootstrap_hash; this stales approval of ip-wiki-lint; no approvals.json exists, so nothing is actually stale)
- commit: a68667b

## [2026-10-08] lint | tools/ committed (Q-216); quick lint over the whole wiki after the wave-0b ingest

- session: s01
- pages: [ops-wiki-maintenance, ops-approval-workflow, index]
- sources: [raw/evidence/phase-p0-planning/tools-wave0b-check.txt]
- result: 0 errors, 0 warnings. tools/quick_lint.py (byte-identical to the ops-wiki-maintenance §5 block) reports 193 files checked, 0 errors; the IP-0-toolchain INDEX-MISSING error of the p0.9 entry is gone. tools/approvals_check.py (byte-identical to the ops-approval-workflow §4 block) adds the SCHEMA §10.2 bootstrap_hash check, fail-closed Q-FORMAT and the §9.7 step 4 CONTRADICTION-registration rule; on the real wiki it reports no Q-FORMAT errors, BOOTSTRAP for phase-p0-planning and BLOCKED for phase-p1-foundation (nothing approved; Q-106, Q-110, Q-207, Q-211 open; adr-0010 CONTRADICTION registered via Q-107). python -m unittest discover -s tools -p "test_*.py": 27 tests OK (fixtures in temp dirs; the hash vectors of ip-data-contract §7 all match; the real plan/approvals.json stayed absent). The test output contains ResourceWarning lines from the SCHEMA §10.2 reference's unclosed open() (harmless; the reference is kept verbatim).
